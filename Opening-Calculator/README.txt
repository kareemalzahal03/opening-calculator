In the game of chess, navigating the opening is vital to building
your position and setting yourself for success.

As a beginner, learning openings can be very complicated since you 
need to learn a wide variety of responses from your oponent and
how to respond in each of them.

To make things worse, in most openings the position is only a few moves
away from becoming a completely different opening. This means even if 
you learn a few of them, you can still be completely clueless on how
to proceed depending on how your oponent responds.

########    What Does This Program Do?    ########

To help you learn openings more efficiently, this program shows you
all possible moves you can make that continues an opening from the 
encyclopedia of chess openings (ECO).

This includes moves that take you to variants of the opening youre 
playing, the main lines, and moves that make you transpose into a
different opening altogether.

These moves are drawn on the screen with green arrows. To make the 
move, click on the piece and where a green arrow is pointing.

########    What Makes This Program Unique?    ########

This program adds all unique opening positions to an undirected 
graph network. It then links nodes together depending on possible
moves in those positions.

This means that not only can you see forward moves, but all the moves
that you could have made in other positions to get here as well. These
are shown with red arrows and can also be used as ways to take the 
position backwards (undo) to a position before it.
